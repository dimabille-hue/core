// --- Centralized information-flow policy (state) ------------------------
//
// `getPlayerView()` remains a Game Pack-owned function -- and honestly,
// for anything involving conditional visibility (fog-of-war: "this
// player's position is visible only if this specific tile has been
// revealed"), it has to be, because that's genuine game semantics no
// generic engine mechanism can know about. What CAN be centralized is
// the common case underneath most of that: "this field is visible only
// to its owner" / "this field is always public" / "this field is never
// visible to anyone but the server". Most of a typical getPlayerView()
// implementation is exactly this pattern, hand-written imperatively over
// and over in every game pack.
//
// `projectFields()` is that centralized primitive: a declarative rule set
// a pack can apply to an object (typically one player's own state slice)
// instead of writing the same `if (id !== viewer) delete obj[field]`
// imperative code by hand. It does not replace getPlayerView() -- a pack
// still owns the function and decides how/where to apply this -- but the
// actual REDACTION DECISION for the common cases becomes an engine-
// validated declaration instead of ad hoc code, and is independently
// testable/reusable across packs.
export const FieldVisibility = Object.freeze({
  PUBLIC: 'ENGINE_FIELD_PUBLIC',       // always visible to every viewer
  OWNER_ONLY: 'ENGINE_FIELD_OWNER_ONLY', // visible only when viewer === the object's owner id
  HIDDEN: 'ENGINE_FIELD_HIDDEN',        // never visible to any viewer (server-internal only)
});

 * `rules`: `{ [fieldName]: FieldVisibility.* | (value, viewer, owner) => boolean }`

 * for objects with no single owner (public/shared state) -- OWNER_ONLY
 * fields on an ownerless object are never visible to anyone.
