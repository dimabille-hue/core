/**
 * Routes matches across a fixed-size pool of worker_threads, each hosting
 * its own subset of matches (see worker.js). `hash(matchId) -> worker`
 * affinity keeps one match's actions strictly ordered (always the same
 * worker, so always processed in the order they arrive) while unrelated
 * matches on different workers run fully independently -- including
 * surviving each other's crashes. See worker.js's header comment for the
 * concrete crash this exists to contain.
 *
 * --- Resource limits: real, honest scope ---------------------------
 *
 * `resourceLimits` (memory) and `rpcTimeoutMs` (CPU runaway) below are
 * REAL, load-bearing controls -- not decorative. `resourceLimits` maps
 * directly to `worker_threads`'s own `resourceLimits` option, enforced by
 * V8 itself: a worker whose heap exceeds `maxOldGenerationSizeMb` is
 * killed by the engine, not by anything this code has to detect.
 * `rpcTimeoutMs` is this pool's own CPU watchdog: if a worker's synchronous
 * rule code runs so long that it never gets back to its message loop to
 * respond, the pool treats that as equivalent to a crash (terminate,
 * mark affected matches lost, respawn) rather than hanging every caller
 * of that worker forever.
 *
 * What this does NOT provide, on purpose, stated plainly rather than
 * implied: filesystem access, network access, environment variable
 * access, and `require`/`import` of arbitrary Node built-ins are all
 * completely unrestricted inside a worker -- `worker_threads` shares the
 * same process-wide capabilities as the main thread by default, and
 * Node's own `vm` module documentation explicitly states it "is not a
 * security mechanism" and must not be used to run untrusted code, so
 * this deliberately does not pretend to wrap pack code in one. Real
 * capability restriction (no fs/network/env access unless explicitly
 * granted) needs OS-level process isolation -- a child process running
 * with reduced OS privileges, a container, or a WASM sandbox -- which is
 * a genuinely different, larger engineering effort than what a
 * worker_thread can provide, and is explicitly out of scope here. A
 * signed pack, or a pack run through this pool, is process-crash-isolated
 * and resource-bounded; it is still not safe to treat as untrusted code
 * with malicious intent behind it. See PACK_SECURITY-equivalent notes
 * elsewhere in this repo for the same distinction applied to signatures.
